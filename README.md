Tribute Choice
--------------
Being a huge video game nerd, I had to do something video game related. I thought picking a retro game might be fun so I chose one of the earliest games I remember playing as a kid, particularly as those kinds of point-and-click adventure games inspired the game I made in Scratch for my application. Thinking about it, I should have chosen Prince of Persia, as I played it on DOS which gave me my vague memories of some of the command line commands. But Monkey Island has nice chunky pixel graphics and a ridiculous sense of humour, so it fits me, at least!


What I Learned
--------------
I learned that designing things to look pretty is incredibly hard! I settled for "passable", but may tweak it more in the future if I have time. The exerise helped me solidfy what I'd learned in the lessons. I also learned (or rather remembered from reading about it!) that Markdown is very particular about where you put whitespace. I spent a fair bit of time trying to figure out why it was displaying some of my end tags as text!

Reflections
-----------
Most steps I walked through, remembering or checking what I'd learned in the Freecodecamp lessons, but occasionally I did some additional searches online for the code I needed (I ended up using the Mozilla HTML reference pages). For a couple of the user stories, I did have a cheeky peek into the source for the example tribute page to see what I could dig out.
